Dear Professor F—., 

My name is Ryan Gumlia, I am from Southern California, and I do not know how to
balance the aesthetic and the ethical in my writing. Everything else follows, 
but most significantly, two reasons I want to take your class: I have
questions and I love [n] ^ writing.

When I refer to the aesthetic and the ethical, I refer to a sorry bastardization of the
aesthetic-ethical-religious framework that Kierkegaard lays out in <i>Either/Or</i>, itself a less
sorry bastardization of the ethical framework Hegel lays out in <i>Philosophy of Right</i>.
Essentially, I understand the aesthetic as the subjective realm of personal pleasure, the
ethical as the objective realm of social responsibility, and I apply their distinction as a
guiding framework everywhere. For instance, when writing, I take my aesthetic to adore
play while the ethical demands clarity. We achieve this clarity by designing and
following rules of syntax and semantics. The result is a universal form, as well defined
and minimally ambiguous as possible, that, alongside norms of cooperative intent,
supplies us with a functional language for law and etc.

Hardly one for pleasure, though! How much more fun that realm of play where joys can
sprout from universal cracks, where syntactic transgressions and semantic doubts tease
those parts of our brain that love subverted expectation and discovered solution. Too,
those odd idiosyncrasies of private histories: read him he that walks by wearing his life
on his language sleeve! Text[/ur]ed and stud[d/i]ed with those fragments of [l/y]ore,
enjoining us in t<b>He</b> a<b>ge</b> o<b>l</b>d dialectic of battling subjectivities. The mode wherefore
each abides by what pleases them, distributing commas for Rhythm’s sake, composing
time for that inner Harmony, it whispering, quietly: pause here; all the while the
Grammar shouts—STOP THERE!

My main question is how to negotiate the aesthetic and ethical when I write about
myself. 

It seems to me that writing about oneself is, more than writing about anything else,
writing oneself. But to the extent that the self does not come in universal form, this
translation cannot be of perfect fidelity. In this tension, I wonder a few things. (1) How
should we balance producing effect and transmitting information? (2) Must everything
be parsable, or can the cryptic be valuable? (3) Are we our preferences—that is, am I
giving too much weight to the aesthetic arbiter within that stakes its life on a break here,
confusion there, and mix to boot? (4) Should I subjugate this internal norm to the ethical
priority of clarity—or one of universal aesthetics—and to what degree? To concretize
some of my concern here, I point to the [n] in the second sentence of this letter. Initially
placed as a reminder that I did not want a verb form, it’s a head notation I learned in
“Morphology I” this semester: immediately parsable, and thus enriching, for me, but I
imagine less for, if not at all, and thus potentially offensive to, others. I leave it as
example of the hyperreferential and (yes) alienating mode I list toward of late, a
modernish juxtaposition of everything, everywhere, all at once, a—I’ve defended—meticulous and excited treatment of all atoms for word and life.

I owe this list to my most recent influence. Kierkegaard’s proven determinant on my
approach to writing, but Proust and Joyce (in that order) have stoked it most proper. (in
that order) because things have changed since DS. <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> terms, I
stepped off that storied train, whose continuous track still remembers the classroom in
which I read “Finger of God,” and in the act relinquished, like the forlorn poets before
me who could neither themselves handle narrative’s frustrating hope, the power of
helpful image and linear coherence, stealing instead for the slippery discreteness that
composes our universe. In <i>Ulysses</i> terms, then “Eumaeus” now “Sirens.” In my terms, I
really have found more utility in Joyce’s infinites. Was Buck Mulligan stately, or did he
come stately? In that second sentence above, do I love writing the product, activity, or
both? In the same, could [n] operate as a sort of non-non Chrysostomos?

The less charitable explanation for my transformation is that I am insecure, that not only
do I obscure void content with decorative form, but that I deliberately contrive it all so
as to be immune to audit. This explanation says I approach you as a less earnest Marlow,
attempting to account to myself for my experiences, desperate to be understood, but
making a falser attempt to communicate than a vain one. I have this anxiety. I sublimate
it in an over-intellectualization of the writing act and Kierkegaard. I want to say more,
and I want badly for others to take pleasure in how I say it. I apply to your class also
because I want to improve. I want to sharpen this craft that is one of our best ways to
share: my passion for lattes and freeways, my knotted dilemmas at studying Lukács
before laying over in finance on the way to law school. And if I come on strong with my
questions, I hope I don’t impress that I am interested merely in transaction, in
graduating with definite answers or clearer conscience. Just as my aesthetic-ethical
framework developed in the company of three friends, I hope it may as well dissolve and
another be born in the company of eleven new, stretched and prodded by a soirée of
approaches. What won’t dissolve, though, is my contribution: I love language at its most
granular, and even more, I love learning how others see that granularity.

In your course, I would prove a relentless well of interest in how others write what they
mean to say and how they understand what they write to mean what they mean to
say—why they decide final forms: their internal harmonies, their comfort with risk, their
reverence or irreverence for convention. I admit that this interest can sometimes trade
off with one in content writ large (or content in the traditional sense), but I suggest that
the interplay between form and content is illuminating—that my desire is, at its least,
still a desire to understand the other, and at its most, capable of an even more salient
understanding. It’s to try for what lives in between the word boundaries, what shapes
the morphemes, to beg for a grasp of the function that maps signified to sign and is
thus applicable to all. This may be a fool’s errand. My premise that each of us refract in
our writing via a unique and externally legible Rosetta Stone could just follow from
naive egocentrism. Even if so, I proffer the positive externality of warmth. My tries
manifest in close reading, in longform questions in longform responses, and in
extraclass association. In friends and better ones. And I hope for the chance to make
more in your course next semester.

Sincerely,

Ryan
