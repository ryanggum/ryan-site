      <p>Dear Reader,</p>
      <p>
        My name is Ryan Gumlia, I am from Southern California, and I do not know
        how to balance the aesthetic and the ethical in my writing. Everything
        else follows, but most significantly: questions in light of a love for
        [n] ^ writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I refer to the aesthetic and the ethical, I refer to a sorry
        bastardization of the aesthetic-ethical-religious framework that
        Kierkegaard lays out in <i>Either/Or</i>, itself a less sorry
        bastardization of the ethical framework Hegel lays out in{" "}
        <i>Philosophy of Right</i>. Essentially, I understand the aesthetic as
        the subjective realm of personal pleasure, the ethical as the objective
        realm of social responsibility, and I apply their distinction as a
        guiding framework everywhere. For instance, when writing, I take my
        aesthetic to adore play while the ethical demands clarity. We achieve
        this clarity by designing and following rules of syntax and semantics.
        The result is a universal form, as well defined and minimally ambiguous
        as possible, that, alongside norms of cooperative intent, supplies us
        with a functional language for law and etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hardly one for pleasure, though! How much more fun that realm of play
        where joys can sprout from universal cracks, where syntactic
        transgressions and semantic doubts tease those parts of our brain that
        love subverted expectation and discovered solution. Too, those odd
        idiosyncrasies of private histories: read him he that walks by wearing
        his life on his language sleeve! Text-ur-ed and studd-i-ed with those
        fragments of l-yore, enjoining us in tHe age old dialectic of battling
        subjectivities. The mode wherefore each abides by what pleases them,
        distributing commas for Rhythm’s sake, composing time for that inner
        Harmony, it whispering, quietly: pause here; all the while the Grammar
        shouts—STOP THERE!
      </p>
      <p>
        My main question is how to negotiate the aesthetic and ethical when I
        write about myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems to me that writing about oneself is, more than writing about
        anything else, writing oneself. But to the extent that the self does not
        come in universal form, this translation cannot be of perfect fidelity.
        In this tension, I wonder a few things. (1) How should we balance
        producing effect and transmitting information? (2) Must everything be
        parsable, or can the cryptic be valuable? (3) Are we our
        preferences—that is, am I giving too much weight to the aesthetic
        arbiter within that stakes its life on a break here, confusion there,
        and mix to boot? (4) Should I subjugate this internal norm to the
        ethical priority of clarity—or one of universal aesthetics—and to what
        degree? To concretize some of my concern here, I point to the [n] in the
        second sentence of this letter. Initially placed as a reminder that I
        did not want a verb form, it’s a morphological head notation I learned
        recently: immediately parsable, and thus enriching, for me, but I
        imagine less for, if not at all, and thus potentially offensive to, you.
        I leave it as example of the hyperreferential and (yes) alienating mode
        I list toward of late, a modernish juxtaposition of everything,
        everywhere, all at once, a—I’ve defended—meticulous and excited
        treatment of all the atoms of word and life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I owe this list to my most recent influence. Kierkegaard’s proven
        determinant on my approach to writing, but Proust and Joyce (in that
        order) have most stoked it proper. (in that order) because things have
        changed since DS. <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> terms, I stepped off
        that storied train, whose continuous track still remembers the classroom
        in which I read “finger of God,” and in the act relinquished, like the
        forlorn poets before me who could neither themselves handle narrative’s
        frustrating hope, the power of helpful image and linear coherence,
        stealing instead for the slippery discreteness that composes our
        universe. In <i>Ulysses</i> terms, then “Eumaeus,” now “Sirens.” In my
        terms, I really have found more utility in Joyce’s infinites. Was Buck
        Mulligan stately, or did he come stately? In that second sentence above,
        do I love writing the product, activity, or both? In the same, could [n]
        operate as a sort of non-non Chrysostomos?
      </p>
      <p>
        The less charitable explanation for my transformation is that I am
        insecure, that not only do I obscure void content with decorative form,
        but that I deliberately contrive it all so as to be immune to audit.
        This explanation says I approach you as a less earnest Marlow,
        attempting to account to myself for my experiences, desperate to be
        understood, but making a falser attempt to communicate than a vain one.
        I have this anxiety. I sublimate it in an over-intellectualization of
        the writing act and Kierkegaard. I want to say more, and I want badly
        for others to take pleasure in how I say it. I write to you also because
        I want to improve. I want to sharpen this craft that is one of our best
        ways to share: trivial passions for lattes and freeways or knotted
        dilemmas re: pre-professional Lukács. And if I come on strong with my
        questions, I hope I don’t impress that I am interested merely in
        transaction, in definite answers or clearer conscience. Just as my
        aesthetic-ethical framework developed in the company of three soulful
        friends, I hope it may as well dissolve and another be born in the
        company of yours and others, stretched and prodded by a soirée of
        approaches. What won’t dissolve, though, is my contribution: I love
        language at its most granular, and even more, I love learning how you
        might see that granularity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should we meet—should you share, too—you will find me a relentless well
        of interest in how you write what you mean to say and how you understand
        what you write to mean what you mean to say—why you decide final forms:
        your internal harmonies, your comfort with risk, your reverence or
        irreverence for convention. I admit that this interest can sometimes
        trade off with one in content writ large (or content in the traditional
        sense), but I suggest that the interplay between form and content is
        illuminating—that my desire is, at its least, still a desire to
        understand you, and at its most, capable of an even more salient
        understanding. It’s to try for what lives in between the word
        boundaries, what shapes the morphemes, to beg for a grasp of the
        function that maps signified to sign and is thus applicable to all. This
        may be a fool’s errand. My premise that each of us refract in our
        writing via a unique and externally legible Rosetta Stone could just
        follow from naive egocentrism. Even if so, I proffer the positive
        externality of warmth. My tries manifest in close reading, in longform
        questions in longform responses, and in extraletter association. In
        friends and better ones. And I hope for the chance to make yours soon.
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Ryan</p>
