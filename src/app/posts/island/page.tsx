        One hour into the trip, the 2014 Toyota Sienna that Josh and I parked
        half a mile from Costco’s Kailua-Kona warehouse refused to start. Two
        hours into the trip—after flooding the engine, communing with Chat, and
        last gasp slamming down on both the brake and the gas—she roared to
        life. So we took a victory lap, trotting the triumph around the lot
        until Scott gained on our course and waved us into his lot, to its back,
        to Ernesto, whose son taught me how to pop the hood and gently explained
        that radiators should not float in antifreeze, and that his father’s
        amusement meant we needed a new car. Three hours into the trip, we
        rolled stylishly out of Scott’s lot in an unregistered 2003 Cadillac
        CTS, and three hours and three minutes into the trip, I released her
        parking brake.

        She was a beater, he said. We didn’t like his cynicism and set out on
        the 9,000 foot ascent of Mauna Kea. Clouds and showers had kicked us out
        of the bay beside the apartment, and the visitor center’s livestream
        promised we could make it above them for a clear night without
        moonlight. We picked up food at Da Broke Mouth Grindz, packed into the
        CTS with heaping plates of well seasoned meat and rice, and started the
        navigation. Maps suggested an hour and a half ride, but Maps wasn’t
        familiar with our game. We discovered early that going a decimal over
        40mph caused the CTS to shake uncontrollably, so we cruised at 39,
        taunting law enforcement though the 40-minimums and splitting the cloud
        cover with the virulence of Icarus were he depressed.

        We arrived at 9:00pm and for the last part of the drive batted off hard
        the urges to look past the specks hanging on the horizon and splattering
        our windshield like bugs, and committed still to a true first sight,
        stole up an outcropping with eyes trained on the glow my phone could get
        to the ground. It was windy. The gusts belayed us despite their 30
        percent less effective oxygen content and no less effectively struck
        into me fear. Forgive me, please, conceptually: a lion’s share up the
        tallest mountain on Earth, stranded by some 2,400 miles of gruesome
        water and air and panting on pitch black, nerves kicked out my knees. I
        am lucky Josh kicked them on. We made the peak and burrowed behind some
        rocks before looking up.

        What to do with a night sky? This was not a matter of white dotting
        black but bright dotting light, flowers—Rigel, Sirius, them all—topping
        the hazy undergrowth like drips on brush sweeps: North South East and
        West spinning did not discriminate, the patterns stretched to every
        horizon even though we had to... in the sea do you soften your gaze and
        float on a blur or do you pick on the darting fish and chase the schools
        and dive deep into the crevices where the anemones bloom—I jumped at
        Orion at the shooting stars flitting beneath his belt teeming all across
        my hands while Josh clawed long by me up a boulder yelling down the
        hunter’s great dog, the canine’s teeth bared and snarling at our
        intrusion then our retreat to behind the Ursas our recollection of
        bearings in Jupiter’s eye on our long arc West borne by the current of
        the galaxy on the tracks of Vega falling over the edge of the world for
        Lyra all left in our minds: the choice.

        I couldn’t sleep that night. As we walked down the hill not more than
        once did we shoot our heads back in ridiculous ambush, too weak to
        appreciate the nature of our revolution and too lost in the awe that
        looking up didn’t somehow turn off the sky. Admittedly we hadn’t really
        begun the return. After it in bed my breath remained short and hostile;
        no rhythm of exhale could change the fact that at sea level you must
        trust they are still above you, that she has not dissipated—those few
        glimmers to survive the distance not all there is left, and that parting
        with vibrance until tomorrow or tomorrow will not preclude you from
        seeing it again.

        Around 4:00am I moved to the balcony and held 100 Years of Solitude to
        my chest until dawn made it light enough to read. The mornings in
        Kailua-Kona are nicely tame. The island’s volcanic spine protects the
        west side from sunrise and channels its harshest lights into the clouds.
        After watering Hilo, the northeast trade winds push what is left over
        the mountains to be burnt off by noon, but not before blazing a
        brilliant pink and gold in a dying announcement of Kona’s day. Josh rose
        to it, and we regrouped with my laptop.

        In deference to the CTS’s age, we abridged the expedition planned for
        the Sienna and cut Volcanoes National Park from a southern itinerary now
        solely focused on Papakōlea Beach. For fuel we stopped at Kaya’s Coffee
        in Captain Cook, where Josh put away a salted caramel brownie and I
        three bananas. We were confident we could make the hour and a half drive
        in two, and to pass the time, we had each other. More importantly, we
        had Sasha K. of The Beat. Her station crackled into range the night
        before and turned an instant classic by playing of KPop Demon Hunters
        banger “Golden” three times in a row. The station knew what we wanted
        (all the hits), when we wanted them (now), and at that The Beat (93.9 FM
        “All the Hits, Now”) excelled, running only three ads an hour (the same
        three) around Abbey Road-esque mixes of Taylor Swift, Lola Young, and
        Sia.

        We left the highway to the opening chords of “The Fate of Ophelia” and
        bore south down a winding yellow line to South Point, the southern most
        of both Hawaii and the United States. Though the beach is not accessible
        by road, families rent out the beds of their pickup trucks at a
        makeshift lot three miles west, and every forty minutes or so, one of
        the beasts will pitch along a groove in the landscape, grinding in
        deeper a wide braid of routes that have come to scar the scrubland
        orange, and exposing each time more basaltic iron for pulverization and
        oxidization by the seemingly endless southern gale. We knew it well as
        we hiked the coast, splitting shore rock and pastures in one long lean
        against the blast that was quite proficient at finding the right silts
        for our eyes, which otherwise made out barren gorgeous.

        At the crest of the bay, olivine joined the mix for a sharper lashing.
        Josh dove under it and sprinted down the 60 percent grade of tinted sand
        for a smooth dive into the surf. More calculated than me on land and
        sea, I climbed down the western edge to maximum gristle and a slick
        bending in the first major breaks. It was awesome: the swim was what we
        needed: teal on olive washed the dirt off our faces and in pristine form
        refracted long white rays that stretched unbroken from its surface to
        the ground.

        We hung in the swells refracted too for a while until the delight of
        refresh turned into the delight of play and a joyful cadence of crest
        rides into low returns into crest rides dissolved into a calmer rhythm,
        and I landed on point break—wanting a tough smash on the way out, but at
        that peak hit sand, twisted into a wall of solid foam and lost my head
        over my arms in a barrel tide—body, my body kept the idea of jamming a
        foot into the coarse and wavering up a lean on the horizon, there to be
        smacked again by a cap that barely left my chest out of the water, the
        marin now running a shining pink. Sun dries by exhausting the water and
        bleaching less than sand I, bounced in the next strike watched sea and
        shore blend, tackled ebb by ebb until looking back and straight at the
        sun, that made salt in my ears, watched the steady heat beat better,
        better, better in the licking crashes, beared not by cliffs, depth, or
        earth but really, really, really none of the places rather who to be
        joined in the frame of fire.

        Back, land stretched surreal. Windless and in the northern fence, we
        pushed the boat launch until even in her there were no words, none as
        the horsediggers diagonaled our plod and none as Josh pushed the CTS,
        finding that quiet settled her with us any over 60. Home, Josh says I
        ate milk and tuna, I he a quarter caesar salad, and surprise we sans
        caloric survival instinct had sans caloric survival instinct, fed more
        on the Last Crusade, crushing weakened in the cycle of dreams.
